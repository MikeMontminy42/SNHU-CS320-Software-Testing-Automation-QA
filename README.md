# Ensuring Functional Products

To ensure proper functionality I had to impelement a series of JUnit test cases to validate all methods used were functioning as expected. Using JUnit for test cases helps to catch any logical errors that you may be missing whether it be small or massive. To improve overall security I chose to follow a few key principles of secure coding. These principles included validatiion for all inputs, limiting sensitive data access, and testing as many possible edge cases for issues. All of these will help to prevent the discovery of massive vulnerabilities by an outside source and prevent random software crashes at the worst possible time.

# Interpreting & Incorporating User Needs

Understanding all of the user's needs starts with being able to take the requirements and break them down into specific features within a software. For example, in the ContactService milestone I had to ensure proper features such as being able to update, remove, add, and change a contact or the associated details. I also had to make sure for security and stability poruposes to check all edge cases and ensure that the inputs stay within the specified character limits.

# My Design Approach

My approach started out with first breaking down all of the requirements into their respective compmenets and then completing them individually. I chose to use reusable classes to separate the hash tables that store the contact data and the service logic which contolled adjusting, adding, or removing any piece of data. I also designed and developed with the testing that needed to be done in mind. This ultimately helped to ensure the code itself is leagues more modular than if I had not had this mindset. Being able to have clean code, modular code, unit testing, and extensive case checks allow for software with exceptional reliability and functionality.
